    <h1>Measuring Accessibility for San Francisco Students: A Geospatial Analysis of Parks, Transit, and School Environments</h1>
    <p>Aiji Li, Anika Sikka, Danielle Murphy, Kathryn Sun (Group 26)</p>
    <h2> Intro: Problem And Motivation </h2>
    <p>
        Access to public transportation, parks, and recreational spaces plays a critical role in shaping students’ daily experiences, influencing how easily they can travel to school, participate in after-school activities, and engage with their surrounding neighborhoods. These forms of accessibility might vary substantially across space, reflecting historical patterns of infrastructure investment, land use, and neighborhood development. Understanding how these spatial disparities manifest around schools is essential for evaluating educational equity and identifying areas where students may face structural barriers to mobility and access to public space.
        <br><br>
        In this project, we investigate spatial patterns of transit accessibility and park access for middle and high schools across San Francisco. Using geospatial analysis, we examine how access to public transportation and parks varies in the areas immediately surrounding schools, and whether these patterns differ systematically between public and private institutions. Rather than focusing solely on proximity, we adopt accessibility-based measures that incorporate walkability, service frequency, and neighborhood context, providing a more realistic representation of students’ lived access to urban infrastructure.
        <br><br>
        To conduct this analysis, we integrate multiple geospatial datasets, including public and private school locations from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (2025), OpenStreetMap street networks processed with OSMnx for walkability analysis, San Francisco Recreation & Parks data for green-space accessibility, San Francisco Planning’s 2023 Land Use dataset, and U.S. Census ACS 5-Year Estimates for demographic context. All datasets were cleaned, projected, and analyzed using GeoPandas, enabling consistent spatial joins, distance-based calculations, and visualization.
        <br><br>
        The findings of this project are relevant to urban planners, transportation agencies, and policymakers concerned with educational equity. By identifying spatial disparities and clusters of high or low accessibility around schools, this analysis can help inform targeted investments in transit service, pedestrian infrastructure, and public spaces, particularly in neighborhoods where students may face compounded access constraints.

    <h3>Creating a Transit Accessibility Score</h3>

    <p>
      When considering <em>transit accessibility</em>, which has no universal
      definition, there are a variety of methodologies used to examine the concept.
      As discussed in
      <a href="https://ira.lib.polyu.edu.hk/bitstream/10397/92556/1/EE-0265_Chung_Review_Transit_Accessibility.pdf"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Chung (Review of Transit Accessibility Measures)
      </a>,
      one group of approaches includes <strong>distance-based methods</strong>,
      such as Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL), which is commonly used
      in the United Kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      PTAL incorporates average waiting time based on service frequency and
      reliability. This provides more insight than simple stop counts, as it
      accounts for how often transit service is available and how reliable it is.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other approaches discussed in the literature include
      <strong>gravity-based methods</strong>, which assign weights to destinations,
      and <strong>utility-based accessibility measures</strong>, which apply a
      utility function to urban opportunities. Due to the complexity of these
      approaches, we construct a score inspired by PTAL as a reasonable and
      interpretable metric for transit accessibility.

  <!-- Computing Score -->
  <!-- ========================= -->
  <section id="computing-accessibility">
    <h3>Computing the Accessibility Score</h3>

    <h4>Data Integration</h4>
    <p>
      School–stop walking times are joined with stop–route service frequency data
      using <code>stop_id</code>, enabling integration of pedestrian access and
      transit supply.
    </p>

    <h4>Accessibility Weight Formulation</h4>
    <p>
      To combine transit supply with walking access, an
      <strong>Accessibility Weight (AW)</strong> is computed for each
      school–stop–route combination:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
        AW = (vehicles per hour) / (walk time + α)
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      where <code>α</code> is a fixed penalty term (set to 2.0) that prevents
      extremely small walking times from disproportionately inflating the score.
    </p>

    <h4>Best-Stop Selection</h4>
    <p>
      For each school and transit route, only the stop with the maximum
      accessibility weight is retained. This reflects the assumption that travelers
      will choose the most accessible boarding point for a given route.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Accessibility Weight captures a stop’s contribution to a school’s public
      transit accessibility. The weight increases with higher service frequency and
      is downweighted by walking time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The formulation models diminishing returns: the difference between a 2- and
      4-minute walk is more consequential than the difference between a 12- and
      14-minute walk. This reflects the tendency for longer walking distances to
      strongly reduce perceived transit convenience.
    </p>

    <p>
      To avoid double-counting transit service that appears at multiple nearby
      stops for the same route, we do not sum across all reachable stops. Instead,
      the final transit accessibility score for each school is computed as the sum
      of the top five accessibility weights across distinct routes.

  <!-- Spatial Analysis -->
  <!-- ========================= -->
  <section id="spatial-analysis">
    <h3>Methods of Analysis: Spatial Correlation and LISA Cluster Identification</h3>

    <p>
      Spatial autocorrelation in school transit accessibility was assessed using
      both <strong>Global Moran’s I</strong> and
      <strong>Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)</strong>.
      Global Moran’s I provides an overall measure of spatial dependence by
      evaluating whether PTAL scores across all schools are spatially clustered,
      dispersed, or randomly distributed.
    </p>

    <p>
      A positive Global Moran’s I indicates that schools with similar transit
      accessibility tend to be located near one another, while values near zero
      suggest a spatially random pattern. Statistical significance is assessed
      using permutation-based tests.
    </p>

    <p>
      To identify localized clustering, we applied LISA, which decomposes the
      global statistic into school-level measures of spatial association. For each
      school, a local Moran’s I statistic is computed using distance-based spatial
      weights, comparing the school’s standardized PTAL score to the average PTAL
      scores of neighboring schools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Schools are classified into four cluster types:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>High–High:</strong> Schools with above-average PTAL scores surrounded
        by neighbors with similarly high scores.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Low–Low:</strong> Schools with below-average PTAL scores located near
        other low-accessibility schools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High–Low:</strong> Spatial outliers with high PTAL scores surrounded
        by lower-accessibility neighbors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Low–High:</strong> Spatial outliers with low PTAL scores surrounded
        by higher-accessibility neighbors.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Statistical significance for each local classification is evaluated using
      permutation-based tests. Only schools with significant local Moran’s I values
      are assigned to LISA cluster categories, ensuring that identified clusters
      reflect meaningful spatial structure rather than random variation.

    <h2> Data & Cleaning </h2>
    <h3> 511 GTFS Transit Data </h3>
    <p>
        Rather than relying on a single operator's feed (e.g., SFMTA), we used the active regional GTFS feed provided by 511, which aggregates schedule data across all publicly available Bay Area transit agencies. This regional feed was accessed via the 511 GTFS Feed Download endpoint by specifying the operator identifier <code>RG</code>, ensuring comprehensive spatial coverage across jurisdictional boundaries
        <br><br>    
        The regional GTFS dataset includes standard GTFS tables such as <code>stops.txt</code>, <code>routes.txt</code>, <code>trips.txt</code>, <code>stop_times.txt</code>, and <code>calendar.txt</code>, which together define transit stop locations, route structures, scheduled vehicle trips, stop-level arrival times, and service calendars. Only static schedule data were used as the analysis focuses on scheduled weekday accessibility rather than live operations. We obtained all descriptions of the data from the <a href="https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#routestxt">General Transit Feed Specification Reference</a>

        <br><br>
        We selected only routes with <code>route_type</code> in <code>{0,1,2,3}</code> which includes any tram/streetcar/light rail service, subway/metro, rail, or bus service. 
    </p>
    <h4>Associating Routes with Stops</h4>
<p>
  As a preprocessing step, we identified the set of transit routes serving each
  stop. The <code>stop_times</code>, <code>trips</code>, and <code>routes</code>
  tables were joined to associate each stop with the unique set of route short
  names that serve it.
</p>

<p>
  For each stop, these route identifiers were aggregated into a single
  comma-separated list, producing a stop-level dataset in which each transit stop
  is annotated with the routes that serve it. This resulting table was then merged
  with the <code>stops</code> GeoDataFrame, preserving spatial information for
  subsequent distance-based accessibility analysis.
</p>

<h3>School Data</h3>

<p>
  We use geospatial school data from FEMA’s Resilience Analysis and Planning Tool
  (RAPT), which aggregates public and private school information from the Homeland
  Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database. The dataset includes spatial
  locations for each uniquely identified school, along with attributes such as
  enrollment and grade span.
</p>

<p>
  Our analysis focuses on schools located within San Francisco city and county
  boundaries.
</p>

<h4>Private School Data</h4>
<p>
  Private school data were obtained from the RAPT ArcGIS Feature Server:
  <a href="https://services.arcgis.com/XG15cJAlne2vxtgt/arcgis/rest/services/Private_Schools_RAPT/FeatureServer">
    https://services.arcgis.com/XG15cJAlne2vxtgt/arcgis/rest/services/Private_Schools_RAPT/FeatureServer
  </a>.
  The data were downloaded in GeoJSON format. Each feature included point
  coordinates stored as separate <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values. These
  coordinates were converted into Shapely <code>Point</code> geometries and used
  to construct a GeoDataFrame with a WGS84 coordinate reference system
  (<code>EPSG:4326</code>).
</p>

<p>
  After loading the data, we filtered the dataset to include only schools located
  in San Francisco by selecting records whose <code>CITY</code> or
  <code>COUNTY</code> fields contained “San Francisco.”
</p>

<h4>Public School Data</h4>
<p>
  Public school data were downloaded directly from the RAPT interface as a CSV
  file and loaded into a GeoDataFrame using the provided latitude and longitude
  coordinates.
</p>

<p>
  The public and private datasets are largely similar in structure. The public
  school dataset includes two additional fields,
  <code>DISTRICTID</code> and <code>GlobalID</code>, which were retained during
  processing.
</p>

<p>
  Several columns, such as <code>WEBSITE</code> and <code>SHELTER_ID</code>,
  contained a high proportion of missing values and were not relevant to our
  analysis. These columns were dropped. A complete list of retained columns is
  provided in the appendix.
</p>

<h4>Classifying School Levels</h4>
<p>
  The public and private school datasets use different systems to encode school
  level, requiring separate classification approaches.
</p>

<h5>Private Schools</h5>
<p>
  Private schools include grade span information via the <code>ST_GRADE</code> and
  <code>END_GRADE</code> fields. However, these fields do not directly encode
  standard grade levels, and official documentation describing the encoding could
  not be located. To interpret these values, we examined all unique
  <code>(ST_GRADE, END_GRADE)</code> pairs and verified representative schools
  through external web searches.
</p>

<p>
  Several consistent patterns emerged. Known high schools such as ICA Cristo Rey
  appeared with <code>ST_GRADE = 14</code> and <code>END_GRADE = 17</code>,
  indicating that codes 14–17 correspond to Grades 9–12. Schools serving Grades
  K–8 or 6–8 frequently had <code>END_GRADE = 13</code>, suggesting that 13 encodes
  Grade 8. Based on these observations, we classified schools with grade spans of
  2–13 or 3–13 as K–8 schools, and those with spans such as 6–13 as middle schools.
</p>

<p>
  A small number of schools required manual inspection. For instance, St.
  Ignatius (11–17) was classified as a high school despite its atypical starting
  grade code; Mother Goose School (2–4) was identified as a preschool; and San
  Francisco Christian School (3–17) serves grades Pre-K through 12. We excluded
  the Edgewood Center for Children &amp; Families after determining that it is not
  a school.
</p>

<p>
  Using these interpretations, each private school was assigned to one of the
  following categories: Elementary, K–8, Middle, High, Preschool, or Other.
</p>

<h5>Public Schools</h5>
<p>
  Public schools are classified using a more descriptive categorical field,
  <code>LEVEL_</code>. We mapped these values to broader categories using the
  following dictionary:
</p>

<pre><code>pub_level_map = {
    "ELEMENTARY": "Elementary",
    "MIDDLE": "Middle",
    "HIGH": "High",
    "OTHER": "Other",
    "NOT REPORTED": None,
}</code></pre>

<h4>Distribution of Schools by Level</h4>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>School Level</th>
      <th>Number of Schools</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Elementary</td><td>88</td></tr>
    <tr><td>K–8</td><td>32</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Middle</td><td>19</td></tr>
    <tr><td>High</td><td>33</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Preschool</td><td>7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Other</td><td>3</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The schools classified as <em>Other</em> are San Francisco Christian School
  (K–12), Five Keys Adult School, and San Francisco County Special Education. For
  the remainder of our analysis, we focus primarily on Elementary, K–8, Middle,
  and High schools.
</p>

<h4>Cleaning Enrollment Data</h4>
<p>
  We next cleaned the enrollment field by converting negative enrollment values
  to missing values. No private schools contained invalid enrollment values.
  However, 9 out of 133 public schools had negative or zero enrollment values.
  These included seven early education or children’s centers, one adult school,
  and one high school.
</p>

<p>
  Upon further investigation, the high school with invalid enrollment data,
  Leadership High, was found to be permanently closed and was removed from the
  dataset.
</p>

<h4>Final School Dataset Construction</h4>
<p>
  The cleaned public and private datasets were concatenated into a single
  GeoDataFrame, <code>schools_sf</code>. Any columns missing from one dataset were
  added with null values, and columns were reordered to ensure schema consistency.
  Finally, we created a unique <code>school_id</code> for each school based on its
  index and confirmed that all geometries were stored in WGS84 coordinates.
</p>

<h3>Parks Data</h3>
<p>
    We used the City of San Francisco parks/open space dataset (CSV) containing one row per park property, including a WKT geometry field (<code>shape</code>) plus basic metadata such as name, address, acreage, and neighborhood labels.
    <br><br>
    <b>Loading + geometry</b>
    <br>
The raw parks table included a <code>shape</code> column storing geometries as WKT strings. We converted that text geometry into shapely objects and built a GeoDataFrame in WGS84:
<br><br>
<pre><code>parks["geometry"] = parks["shape"].apply(wkt.loads)
parks = gpd.GeoDataFrame(parks, geometry="geometry", crs="EPSG:4326")</code></pre>

<b>Cleaning</b>
<br>
Minimal cleaning was needed beyond geometry parsing. We kept the dataset at full extent (San Francisco parks), and relied on the provided latitude/longitude + geometry for mapping and spatial joins.
</p>
<h3>Muni Data</h3>
<p>
  Upon obtaining SFMTA Muni stop data as a GeoJSON file, we dissected the dataset and then performed analysis in conjunction with our preexisting school dataset. Each feature in the dataset contained geographical information about the stops. We reprojected the geometry to ensure spatial consistency with the school isochrone data. 
  <br><br>
  To measure transit accessibility around schools, we performed a spatial join of the Muni stops dataset with the 15-minute walking isochrones computer above. We then grouped the joined dataset by school index to aggregate all stop counts for each school. 
  <br><br> 
  Our data visualization followed our usual practices - we created a color scale based on the maximum number of Muni stops within any school’s isochrone and applied it to the polygons. The darker the shade of the polygon, the more Muni stops existed for that specific school.
  <br><br>
  From this initial visualization, we were also curious about the existence of “transit deserts,” areas where students may face reduced access to public transportation. To locate transit deserts around schools, we examined the empirical distribution of stop counts and summary statistics, including the median the interquartile range. We then classified schools into three transit accessibility categories based on the quartiles:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Transit Desert: schools in the bottom 25% of Muni stop counts
    </li>
    <li>
      Moderate Access: schools between the 25th and 75th percentiles of Muni stop counts
    </li>
    <li>
      High Access: schools in the top 25% of Muni stop counts 
    </li>
  </ol>
  The use of quantiles allows us to identify relative transit disadvantages without imposing a cutoff. It ensures that the definition of a transit desert is based on the observed distribution of access across schools.
  <br><br>
  To visualize the transit accessibility categories, we created an interactive map similar to our other maps in which each school’s 15-minute isochrone is colored accordingly (red for Transit Desert, yellow for Moderate Access, and green for High Access).
  <br><br>
  Our Muni data results provide a clear baseline to complement our PTAL analysis presented later in the paper.

    <h3>Parks and Recreation Access</h3>

    <p>
      Using 15-minute walking isochrones around each school, we counted the number
      of parks intersecting each school’s walkable catchment area. This provides a
      simple and interpretable proxy for the availability of parks and recreation
      spaces reachable on foot from schools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the 183 schools in our dataset, the median school can reach 6 parks
      within a 15-minute walk (interquartile range 4–10), with a mean of 7.0 parks.
      Park access varies substantially across locations, ranging from 0 to 19
      reachable parks. While most schools have access to several nearby parks, a
      small subset of schools have very limited access, highlighting localized gaps
      in park availability that may warrant further attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Park accessibility varies across individual schools but shows only modest
      differences by school level. Elementary schools have a median of 7 parks
      within a 15-minute walk (interquartile range 4–11), while K–8 and high schools
      have similar medians of 6.5 and 6 parks, respectively. Middle schools exhibit
      slightly lower access, with a median of 5 parks, though their interquartile
      range overlaps substantially with other school types.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Preschools exhibit higher average park counts; however, this category includes
      only seven schools and should be interpreted with caution. Overall, the
      substantial overlap in park-access distributions across school levels suggests
      that proximity to parks is driven primarily by neighborhood location rather
      than school type.
      Elementary and K–8 schools display slightly higher median park access compared to middle and high schools, as well as wider interquartile ranges. However, these differences should be interpreted with caution, as elementary and K–8 schools are substantially more numerous in the dataset than middle and high schools. The larger sample sizes for these school levels naturally produce more stable estimates and greater observed variability, while the smaller number of middle and high schools results in more compact distributions that may underrepresent the full range of park accessibility experienced by those school types.

In addition to sample size effects, these patterns likely reflect differences in spatial distribution. Elementary and K–8 schools are more broadly dispersed across residential neighborhoods, where park availability varies considerably from block to block. Middle and high schools, by contrast, are fewer in number and tend to be more spatially clustered, often located along denser corridors where park availability may be constrained. As a result, the narrower distributions observed for middle and high schools may reflect both their limited sample size and their concentration in specific urban contexts rather than inherently more uniform access.

Notably, the substantial overlap in park-access distributions across all school levels indicates that neighborhood location plays a more important role in shaping park accessibility than school level alone. Schools of different types located in the same neighborhoods tend to experience similar access to nearby parks, reinforcing the interpretation that park accessibility is primarily a spatial rather than institutional phenomenon.

    <h4>Scaling by Enrollment</h4>
    <p>
      To account for differences in school size, we also compute park access

    <h3>Public Transit Accessibility Score Results</h3>

    <p>
      Understanding access to public transportation is critical in evaluating how easily students, families, and school staff can travel to and from schools without relying on private vehicles. Public transit accessibility influences daily commuting, after-school activities, and equitable access to educational opportunities, particularly in dense urban environments like San Francisco where transit availability varies substantially by neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before presenting the advanced frequency-weighted PTAL results, we introduce a simpler baseline measure of transit accessibility: the number of Muni stops reachable within a 15-minute walking isochrone around each school. The following 2 maps show the 15-Minute Walk Accessibility to Muni Stops for middle and high schools respectively</p>
      <h4>Walk Accessibility to Muni Stops</h4>

     <p> This metric extends and allows us to visually identify transit deserts. We focused on middle and high schools only, as these students are more likely to independently rely on public transportation to get around. Schools were categorized into transit deserts (bottom 25%), moderate access (middle 50%), and high access (top 25%), and visualized using colored isochrones.
    </p>
    <h4>Transit Deserts: Middle and High Schools</h4>

    <p>
      The resulting map reveals several transit-poor areas, most of which are away from downtown. Schools with more nearby Muni stops are more evenly distributed around the city rather than being concentrated exclusively in central SF. Compared to the PTAL results, this shows less emphasis on downtown accessibility and instead highlights neighborhood-level differences in transit availability. While this metric does not capture frequency, reliability, or access to non-Muni transportation, it is an interesting and useful first step for identifying inequalities in transit access.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public transit accessibility plays a critical role in determining how easily
      students, families, and school staff can travel to and from schools without
      relying on private vehicles. To quantify transit access, we use the Public
      Transit Accessibility Level (PTAL), a composite measure that captures both the
      proximity of transit stops and the frequency of service available within a
      walkable catchment area.
    </p>

    <p>
      PTAL scores were computed using weekday service data, with a primary focus on
      the morning peak period (7–10 AM). Additional time windows, including midday
      off-peak (10 AM–2 PM) and evening peak (4–7 PM), were analyzed to assess the
      temporal robustness of accessibility patterns.
    </p>

    <h4>PTAL Score Distribution</h4>

      <figcaption>
        PTAL scores by school level during the morning peak
        period.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      PTAL scores are broadly similar across school levels, with overlapping
      interquartile ranges and mean values between approximately 4.8 and 5.7. No
      school level consistently exhibits substantially higher or lower transit
      accessibility, suggesting that PTAL primarily reflects neighborhood-level
      transit infrastructure rather than institutional characteristics.

    <h4>Spatial Structure of Transit Accessibility</h4>

    <p>
      Using distance-based spatial weights (1.5 km threshold), we find significant
      positive spatial autocorrelation in PTAL scores (Moran’s I = 0.47, p = 0.001),
      indicating that transit accessibility is spatially clustered rather than
      randomly distributed across schools.
    </p>

        <p>
      The figure reveals a pronounced spatial structure in transit accessibility across San Francisco schools. Using distance-based spatial weights (1.5 km threshold), we find strong positive global spatial autocorrelation in PTAL scores (Moran’s I = 0.47, p = 0.001), indicating that schools with similar levels of transit accessibility are significantly clustered in space rather than randomly distributed. This result confirms that transit accessibility is fundamentally a neighborhood-scale phenomenon shaped by the underlying organization of the transit network.

<b></b>The LISA cluster map further clarifies the nature of this spatial dependence by identifying localized concentrations of high and low accessibility. High–High clusters are concentrated in central and downtown San Francisco, corresponding to areas with dense, frequent, and multimodal transit service. These neighborhoods benefit from overlapping bus, rail, and metro routes with short headways, resulting in consistently high PTAL scores for nearby schools. The spatial contiguity of these clusters highlights how transit-rich corridors create reinforcing accessibility advantages across multiple nearby schools.

In contrast, Low–Low clusters are primarily located in the Sunset District and parts of southern San Francisco. Schools in these areas are surrounded by neighbors with similarly low PTAL scores, reflecting sparser route coverage, longer headways, and fewer high-frequency transit options. The persistence of Low–Low clusters suggests that transit-poor conditions are not isolated anomalies but rather systemic characteristics of certain neighborhoods, potentially reinforcing inequities in students’ daily mobility and access to opportunities.

<b></b>The presence of High–Low and Low–High clusters indicates localized spatial outliers where a school’s transit accessibility differs sharply from that of its surrounding neighbors. These cases may reflect proximity to a single high-frequency corridor embedded within an otherwise transit-poor area, or conversely, schools located slightly off major transit spines within otherwise well-served neighborhoods. Such outliers underscore the importance of fine-grained spatial analysis: even within broadly transit-rich or transit-poor areas, access can vary meaningfully at short distances.

Notably, a substantial share of schools are classified as not locally significant, suggesting that while strong clusters exist, transit accessibility often varies smoothly across space rather than forming sharply bounded regions. 

        <b></b> These results suggest that future work should examine neighborhoods classified as low–low clusters in greater detail to identify the structural, infrastructural, or policy factors underlying these observed  disparities.

    <p>
      We observe a moderate positive association between transit accessibility and
      park accessibility (Spearman’s ρ = 0.38). Schools with higher levels of transit
      access tend, on average, to have greater access to parks, though substantial
      variability remains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Differences across school levels are visible, with elementary and K–8 schools
      more frequently appearing among observations with higher park accessibility.
      Overall, transit and park accessibility represent related but distinct
      dimensions of the urban environment.

<section id="limitations">
  <h2>Limitations and Dark Data</h2>

  <p>
    Several limitations and sources of <em>dark data</em> should be considered when
    interpreting the results of our transit and park accessibility analyses. Dark
    data refers to relevant information that is unavailable, unobserved, or
    difficult to measure, but which nonetheless shapes real-world experiences and
    outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, while the Public Transit Accessibility Level (PTAL) provides a useful
    relative measure of transit availability across schools, its absolute values
    are not directly interpretable in isolation. PTAL is best understood as a
    comparative metric rather than a literal measure of travel time or service
    quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our PTAL metric is derived from static GTFS schedule data, which represent
    planned service rather than observed transit operations. This introduces an
    important form of dark data: real-time transit conditions. Delays,
    cancellations, crowding, and reliability—factors that strongly affect how
    accessible transit feels in practice—are not captured by scheduled data. As a
    result, schools located along routes with frequent scheduled service may still
    experience lower effective accessibility during periods of disruption.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, the walking-access component of PTAL assumes uniform pedestrian
    conditions and does not account for dark data related to sidewalk quality,
    traffic safety, topography, or perceived comfort. These factors influence
    whether transit is realistically usable by students but are not represented in
    the available datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    More broadly, our operationalization of transit accessibility reduces access to
    the number and frequency of scheduled vehicles serving nearby stops. While this
    is a reasonable proxy, it does not capture directional relevance or trip
    purpose, which represent additional forms of dark data. For example, routes
    serving a school may not connect to students’ home neighborhoods, after-school
    destinations, or workplaces, meaning that high PTAL scores may not translate
    into meaningful mobility for all students.
  </p>

  <p>
    Park accessibility measures are also affected by dark data. We measure park
    access based on spatial proximity alone, counting parks that intersect a
    school’s walkable catchment area. This approach does not capture qualitative
    differences among parks, such as size, programming, safety, maintenance, or
    hours of access. A park may be geographically nearby but effectively
    inaccessible to students due to fencing, limited amenities, or perceived
    safety concerns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, enrollment data were incomplete or unreliable for a small number
    of schools, particularly early education centers and adult education
    facilities. Although we removed closed schools and applied minimum enrollment
    thresholds when computing enrollment-normalized park metrics, residual
    inaccuracies in enrollment figures represent another source of dark data that
    may affect scaled accessibility measures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, all analyses are conducted at the school level, which introduces
    limitations related to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and ecological
    fallacy. School-level accessibility metrics obscure individual-level variation
    and behavior—another form of dark data. We do not observe which transit routes
    students actually use, how frequently they visit nearby parks, or how access
    differs across student populations within the same school. These unobserved
    behavioral and demographic factors limit the ability to draw individual-level
    or causal conclusions about accessibility and equity outcomes.
